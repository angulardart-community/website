You don't have to read the documentation straight through,
but here's a possible learning path if you're new to Angular:

1. [Set up]({{< ref setup >}}) your environment, which leads you through
   creating, running, and modifying a simple AngularDart app.

1. Take the [*Tour of Heroes* tutorial]({{< ref tutorial >}} "Tour of Heroes").

   The *Tour of Heroes* takes you step-by-step from setup
   to a full-featured example that demonstrates the essential characteristics of a professional app:
   a sensible project structure, data binding, master/detail, services, dependency injection, navigation, and remote data access.

1. <a id="architecture"></a>Read the [Architecture]({{< ref architecture >}})
   overview for the big picture.

1. Read [Displaying Data]({{< ref displaying-data >}}) to see how data binding puts
   component property values on screen.

1. Read [User Input]({{< ref user-input >}}) to learn how to respond to user-initiated
   DOM events.

1. Read [Forms]({{< ref forms >}}), which covers data entry and validation within the UI.

1. Read [Dependency Injection]({{< ref dependency-injection >}}) to learn how to build
   large, maintainable apps from small, single-purpose parts.

1. Scan [Template Syntax]({{< ref template-syntax >}}),
   a comprehensive study of Angular template HTML.

Then feel free to skip around among the other pages on this site.

### Next step

Try the [tutorial]({{< ref tutorial >}} "Tour of Heroes") if you're ready to start
coding, or visit the [architecture overview]({{< ref architecture >}} "Basic Concepts")
if you prefer to learn the basic concepts first.

### Extra note

Sometimes if you can't find documentation about something for AngularDart, you can try to look for the same thing for [Angular TS]({{< param angular >}}) as the two frameworks are architecturally similar (and were both born at Google!).
